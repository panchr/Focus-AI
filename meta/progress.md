*This page depicts the progress made on the guiding questions as well as the timeline.*

## Guiding Questions Answered

1. How has the Dynamic Scripting algorithm been used to implement learning AI?
2. [What games are suitable and practical for such an AI?](../notes/week-1.md#notes)
3. [What features must a human-like game-playing AI implement?](../notes/week-1.md#ai-features)
4. [What types of data does the AI need to gather for its learning process?](../notes/week-3.md#rulebase)
5. [How will the AI learn?](../notes/week-2.md#decision-making-process)
	1. [In addition to modifying rule weights, can the AI dynamically generate new rules?](../notes/week-4.md#dynamically-generating-rules)
7. How can such an AI be implemented using Python? 
	1. [To store the data, will a robust relational database backend (such as MySQL or PostgresSQL) be required, or is a NoSQL/document database (such as MongoDB) adequate?](../notes/week-5.md#rule-database)
	2. If a suitable game engine cannot be found, can one be developed in Python?
	3. How will the AI interact with a game engine?
8. What type of interface will the primary application be?
	1. If using a web-based interface, how will the website interface with the AI and game engine?
	2. How can a Python-driven AI support concurrent connections?
	3. Can each connection (and respective AI instance) remain isolated from the rest?

## Weekly Work Completed

1. Chose game AI and features
2. Planned structure and decision-making process of AI
3. Determined data that the AI needs to collect
4. Developed basic data models and unit tests and started research on Deep Learning
5. Started working on the core AI features
