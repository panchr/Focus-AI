## General Goal: 
Choose the game for AI and determine the necessary features

### Reading Topic: 
Past AI created with Dynamic Scripting

### Notes

Although RTS (Real-time Strategy) games provide the largest (and arguably, most interesting) domain for AI, they are way too complex for me to work with.
So, I am considering some type of board game, between either Chess or Checkers at the moment.
Overall, there are more Chess AI, so I will have a lot to work off of. On the other hand, Checkers is simpler and probably easier to get players/testers for.

#### AI Features
- Feasibility of implementation
- Learning from gameplay (modifying the rulebase)
- Fast decision making
- Efficient scaling with more users (cannot require significant resources for a single instance of the AI)
- Predictable outcomes
- Difficulty scaling (might be too advanced to implement originally)
